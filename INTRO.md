<p>Let&rsquo;s Trip is a global social project based on blockchain technology, where users can take an active part in creating the historical and tourist ecosystem of the world, and the cryptocurrency will become the main driver of content generation.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s Trip is a daring project. Yes, we are ready to compete for each user with cartographic monopolists; we are ready to completely replace paper atlases, compasses, and translators; in the future, our service will allow you to get good discounts in hotels, banks, and restaurants. We stand for the freedom of speech - add new sights, rate places, write reviews on any location on the general tourist world map.</p>
