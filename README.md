## Introduction

<div class="page" title="Page 3">

			<p><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 12pt;">Let&rsquo;s Trip is a global social project based on blockchain technology, where users can take an active part in creating the historical and tourist ecosystem of the world, and the crypto- currency will become the main driver of content generation.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto;">Traveling by train past an unknown village, walking alongside an old house or just riding a bicycle across a bridge, ask yourself, if you know interesting facts or the history of these</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto;">places? Imagine: there is the world&#39;s unique fish in the river under this bridge; a scientist that invented the radio lived in this house; the station platform, paved with stone from Spain,</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto;">was made back in 1895. Every day people are walking by hundreds of interesting places not knowing its history or meaning. We&rsquo;re forgetting history, losing the thread of the past, ceasing to be interested in the world around us. Cryptocurrency LST will change the perception of traveling.</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto;">Let&rsquo;s Trip is a project that won&#39;t miss anything. Users from all over the world will help to create a real service for the coming decades. Let&rsquo;s Trip has no competitors in its niche, and the reach of a potential audience is more than 1.2 billion people (The World Tourism Orga- nization) from more than 90 countries. The fundamental idea of Let&rsquo;s Trip really works, the</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto;">confirmation is more than 10,000 users in the Russian Federation already, and this figure</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto;">continues to grow every day.</span></p>

						<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto; color: #917ab1;">HOW DID LET&rsquo;S TRIP IDEA CAME UP</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto; color: #262324;">A train. Long road - 18 hours! You are on the road, looking out the window from your com- partment. You drive past cities, factories, rivers, monuments, sights ... But what do you know about these places if you are not a historian?</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto; color: #262324;">Moving through stations, you become interested - what kind of place is it, what its history? You are looking for answers to your questions on the Internet. It turned out, in this city, back in 1917, the Tsar of the Russian Empire, Nicholas II, resigned the throne. Interesting, isn&#39;t it?</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto; color: #262324;">Why did you want to search for this information - you had nothing to do or tired of watch- ing a movie? Why there is no such service that would tell you about the history of near located places? And the idea was born - to develop an app that tells what notable is nearby you.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto; color: #262324;">The idea embodied the goal - to help people learn more. There are thousands of interesting places around the world that we know almost nothing about. Walking around your home-</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto; color: #262324;">town, you may not know the history of the sights you pass by every day. For all the infor</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto; color: #262324;">- mation you need to read a lot of books and websites. It&#39;s easier with Let&rsquo;s Trip! After install- ing the app, you will receive information about interesting places all over the world: from megalopolises to small villages. We invite all users to contribute to the development of the</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto; color: #262324;">service: add interesting locations on the global map; tell city&#39;s, village&#39;s, and town&#39;s stories;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Roboto; color: #262324;">describe the sights, flora, and fauna. The Let&rsquo;s Trip cryptoactives will stimulate the content generation.</span></p>
